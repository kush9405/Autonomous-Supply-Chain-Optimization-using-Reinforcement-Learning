# Autonomous Supply Chain Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

This repository implements a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize supply chains. The goal is to make supply chains autonomous by leveraging machine learning techniques to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and adapt to dynamic environments.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Framework**: Implements state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for decision-making in supply chains.
- **Simulation Environment**: Simulates real-world supply chain scenarios for training and testing.
- **Optimization Tools**: Provides utilities for optimizing inventory, transportation, and production processes.
- **Visualizations**: Includes tools for visualizing the performance and decision-making process.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kush9405/Autonomous-Supply-Chain-Optimization-using-Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd Autonomous-Supply-Chain-Optimization-using-Reinforcement-Learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Configure the Environment**: Update the configuration files to fit your supply chain model.
2. **To Run this code **: Train the reinforcement learning agent by running:
   ```bash
   python implementation.py --config config.yaml
   ```

### Changes and Fixes:
- Ensured all headings use `#`, `##`, or `###` for proper hierarchy.
- Fixed links to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and other sections to be clickable.
- Verified that the code blocks use proper triple backticks (` ``` `) with language identifiers.
- Removed unnecessary or redundant lines to keep the file clean and professional.

Let me know if further refinements are needed!
